description: Codex-orchestrated deep research — Antigravity (agy / Gemini) does the grounded web legwork cheaply; Codex plans, verifies the citations, and synthesizes. Use for multi-source research questions that need cited findings.
---

Run a multi-source research pass, following the **Verification gates** of the
plugin's delegation policy. Antigravity (`agy` / Gemini) is the cheap, grounded
search worker; **you (Codex) own the plan, the verification, and the synthesis**.
agy's print-mode citations are coarse (often domain-level) and it can present
parametric "knowledge" as a sourced fact — so never ship its citations unchecked.

Use `agy-delegate` from PATH, or `<plugin-root>/scripts/agy-delegate.sh` (plugin
root = two directories above this SKILL.md). If the topic is unclear, ask the user
what to research before starting.

Do this:
1. **Plan (you).** Break the topic into 3–6 sub-questions and list the load-bearing
   claims that must be verified. You own scope and final synthesis.
2. **Fan-out fetch (agy, cheap, one call per sub-question).** Web search needs
   `--yolo` in headless mode; force compact output so bulky pages stay on Gemini's
   side, not yours:
   `agy-delegate --tier flash --yolo "Web-search <sub-question>. Return 5–8 bullet findings, each with the exact source URL and publication date. Output ONLY findings + URLs + dates."`
3. **Deepen on each load-bearing claim (agy).** Name the URL and have agy quote the
   supporting sentence(s), turning domain-level citations into verifiable quotes:
   `agy-delegate --tier pro --yolo "Open <URL> and quote the exact sentence(s) supporting: '<claim>'. If the page does not support it, reply NOT SUPPORTED."`
4. **Adversarially verify (you).** Corroborate each key claim across ≥2 independent
   domains; treat any single / vague / domain-only citation as unverified;
   sanity-check dates; watch for Gemini parametric knowledge posing as a sourced
   fact.
5. **Synthesize (you).** Write a cited report from verified findings only;
   explicitly mark anything uncorroborated as "unverified".

Keep your own context lean — ingest agy's bullet digests, not the raw pages (that's
where the cost savings come from). `--print` does one agentic pass per call, so
re-dispatch follow-up agy calls to close gaps rather than expecting it to
auto-iterate. In an interactive session a long fetch can be backgrounded with
`agy-job`; when **you** are headless (`codex exec`), delegate synchronously.
