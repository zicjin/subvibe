# drivers/agy.sh — Antigravity CLI (`agy`) driver for subvibe-delegate.sh.
#
# A driver adapts one headless subagent CLI to the core's normalized contract.
# It is sourced (not executed) by scripts/subvibe-delegate.sh and must define the
# functions below. See docs/drivers.md for the full interface and how to add a
# new driver (e.g. grok, devin).
#
# Normalized inputs the core provides (read-only for the driver):
#   MODEL TIMEOUT ADD_DIRS[] YOLO SANDBOX CONTINUE CONV_ID PROMPT
#
# agy v1.0.x quirks this driver owns:
#   * `-p/--print` TAKES THE PROMPT AS ITS VALUE -> prompt args go last.
#   * No `--output-format json` -> plain-text only (core enforces the contract).
#   * Headless with no TTY it can drop stdout / hard-hang (worst on native
#     Windows without ConPTY) -> core's stdin detach + wall-clock guard.
#   * Without --dangerously-skip-permissions, headless agy only DESCRIBES
#     edits and writes nothing, yet still exits 0 (issue #10).
#   * `--add-dir` over a WSL /mnt/* Windows mount reads via a slow 9p bridge.

# Read by the sourcing core, which shellcheck can't see across files.
